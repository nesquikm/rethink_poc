# Rethink AI POC Project Brief

## Project Overview
Rethink AI is a proof-of-concept (POC) application that aims to demonstrate a multi-model AI chat interface that can leverage multiple AI providers concurrently and select the best response through a voting mechanism.

## Core Requirements

1. **Multi-Model Integration**:
   - Connect to multiple AI models including OpenAI's GPT models, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude
   - Present responses from all models to the user

2. **Response Evaluation System**:
   - Implement a voting mechanism where each AI model evaluates the responses from all models
   - Highlight the "best" response based on the voting results

3. **User Experience**:
   - Intuitive chat interface
   - Clear indication of which model provided each response
   - Visual highlighting for the winning response
   - Real-time loading indicators

4. **Extensibility**:
   - Codebase should be designed to easily add new AI models/providers
   - Architecture should support future features like conversation history, model selection, etc.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Tech Stack**:
   - Next.js 15+ with App Router
   - React 19+
   - TypeScript
   - TailwindCSS
   - API integrations with OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude

2. **Performance**:
   - Efficient parallel API calls to different providers
   - Responsive UI during model response generation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful handling of API failures
   - Clear error messaging to users
   - Fallback mechanisms when specific models fail

## Scope and Limitations

**In Scope**:
- Chat interface with multiple model responses
- Voting system for determining best responses
- Basic conversation flow without persistent history
- Error handling and loading states

**Out of Scope** (for future iterations):
- User authentication
- Persistent conversation history
- Fine-tuning of models
- Advanced prompt engineering features
- Streaming responses
- Model context length management

## Success Criteria
- All integrated models successfully return responses
- Voting system correctly identifies and highlights the "best" response
- UI/UX is intuitive and provides clear feedback
- System handles errors gracefully
- Performance is acceptable with parallel API calls
