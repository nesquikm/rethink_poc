- ✅ Model-specific color coding for responses
- ✅ Loading indicators during API requests
- ✅ Clear error states for failed requests
- ✅ Clean message bubbles with distinguishing features
- ✅ Conversation history clearing option
- ✅ Persistent conversation history via localStorage
- ✅ Tabbed navigation between different AI responses
- ✅ Default selection of "best answer" tab
- ✅ Turn-based conversation structure with user/AI grouping
- ✅ Visual indicators for locked/selected responses
- ✅ Disabled state for tabs in previous conversation turns
- ✅ "SELECTED" badge for chosen responses in conversation history
- ✅ Fixed width layout for consistent user experience

### Architecture
- ✅ Centralized model configuration in backend

- ✅ Basic context window management
- ✅ Selected response tracking for conversation history
- ✅ Locking of older message selections
- ❌ Advanced context window management for very long conversations
- ❌ Token counting and truncation
- ❌ Conversation session management

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Response streaming for faster initial feedback
- ❌ Caching mechanisms for repeated queries
- ❌ User preferences for default models
- ❌ Custom system prompts per model
- ❌ Temperature and parameter controls
- ❌ Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for web content access

### Performance & Reliability
- ❌ API request retry mechanisms
- ❌ Fallback cascade for unavailable models
- ❌ Performance monitoring and analytics
- ❌ Cost control mechanisms for API usage

### Extensibility
- ✅ Centralized model configuration for easy additions
- ✅ Provider-agnostic model integration
- ✅ Shared model definition system
- ❌ Plugin system for additional features
- ❌ User-configurable model parameters
- ❌ Custom model groupings and comparisons

## Current Status

The application is currently in a **functional state with a shared model definition system, improved UI, and conversation context management** with the following characteristics:

### Development Status
- **Frontend**: ~99% complete for MVP functionality
- **API Integration**: 100% complete for target models
- **Error Handling**: ~85% complete
- **Conversation Management**: ~85% implemented (with selected response tracking)
- **UI/UX**: ~95% complete for core features
- **Architecture**: ~95% complete with shared model system (pending import fixes)

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Local development only
- **CI/CD**: Not set up
- **Hosting**: Not configured

### Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Not implemented
- **Integration Tests**: Not implemented
- **Manual Testing**: Core functionality verified

## Known Issues

### Functionality Issues
1. **API Rate Limiting**: No handling for rate limit errors from providers
2. **Response Timing**: Slow overall response time due to waiting for all models
3. **Context Window Limits**: No handling for very long conversations exceeding context windows
4. **Tab Reset**: Active tab selection resets on page refresh or browser reload

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fixed width layout may not work well on very small screens
2. **Loading States**: Loading feedback could be more model-specific
3. **Error Messaging**: Error states could be more specific and helpful
4. **Accessibility**: Limited keyboard navigation and screen reader support for tabs

### Technical Debt
1. **Type Safety**: Module import errors in the model system need to be fixed
2. **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling needed across the application
3. **Code Organization**: Chat component is becoming large and could be modularized
4. **Testing**: Complete lack of automated tests
5. **Documentation**: Limited code documentation and comments
