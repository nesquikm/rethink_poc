# Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic chat interface for user interaction
- ✅ API integration with OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini)
- ✅ API integration with Google's Gemini model
- ✅ API integration with Anthropic's Claude model
- ✅ Parallel API requests to all models
- ✅ Display of all model responses
- ✅ Cross-model voting on response quality
- ✅ Visual highlighting for "winning" responses
- ✅ Vote count display

### UI/UX
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Model-specific color coding for responses
- ✅ Loading indicators during API requests
- ✅ Clear error states for failed requests
- ✅ Clean message bubbles with distinguishing features

### Error Handling
- ✅ API error handling for all providers
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms when specific models fail
- ✅ Appropriate error messages to users
- ✅ Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## What's Left to Build

### Conversation Management
- ❌ Persistent conversation history
- ❌ Context window management for longer conversations
- ❌ Conversation state management across sessions
- ❌ User conversation history browsing

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Response streaming for faster initial feedback
- ❌ Caching mechanisms for repeated queries
- ❌ User preferences for default models
- ❌ Dark/light mode toggle
- ❌ Custom system prompts per model
- ❌ Temperature and parameter controls

### Performance & Reliability
- ❌ API request retry mechanisms
- ❌ Fallback cascade for unavailable models
- ❌ Performance monitoring and analytics
- ❌ Cost control mechanisms for API usage

## Current Status

The application is currently in a **working proof-of-concept state** with the following characteristics:

### Development Status
- **Frontend**: ~90% complete for MVP functionality
- **API Integration**: 100% complete for target models
- **Error Handling**: ~80% complete
- **Conversation Management**: 0% implemented

### Deployment Status
- **Environment**: Local development only
- **CI/CD**: Not set up
- **Hosting**: Not configured

### Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Not implemented
- **Integration Tests**: Not implemented
- **Manual Testing**: Basic functionality verified

## Known Issues

### Functionality Issues
1. **API Rate Limiting**: No handling for rate limit errors from providers
2. **Response Timing**: Slow overall response time due to waiting for all models
3. **Context Management**: No maintenance of conversation context between messages
4. **Token Limits**: No handling for long conversations exceeding context windows

### UI/UX Issues
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some layout issues on very small screens
2. **Loading States**: Loading feedback could be more informative
3. **Error Messaging**: Error states could be more specific and helpful
4. **Accessibility**: Needs improvements for screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Technical Debt
1. **Type Safety**: Some areas need improved TypeScript typing
2. **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling needed across the application
3. **Code Organization**: Some components could be further modularized
4. **Testing**: Complete lack of automated tests
5. **Documentation**: Limited code documentation and comments

## Roadmap Status

### Completed Milestones
- ✅ Initial project setup
- ✅ Basic chat UI implementation
- ✅ Multi-model API integration
- ✅ Response voting mechanism
- ✅ UI enhancements for model differentiation

### Current Milestone
🚀 **Conversation Context & Persistence**
- Implementing conversation history management
- Designing context window handling
- Planning persistence strategy
- Improving user experience with conversation flow

### Upcoming Milestones
1. **UI/UX Refinements** (planned start: TBD)
2. **Performance Optimizations** (planned start: TBD)
3. **Advanced Model Configuration** (planned start: TBD)
