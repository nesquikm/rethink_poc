# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the existing multi-model AI chat application with the following key areas of work:

1. **Model and Provider Configuration Centralization**: Further refinement of the model system by creating a shared definition layer to eliminate duplication between client and server code.

2. **UI/UX Refinement**: Improvements to the chat interface layout, particularly focusing on a consistent and wider display for better readability.

3. **Conversation History Management**: Ongoing enhancements to the system that only includes selected AI responses in the conversation history, with a mechanism to lock older selections.

4. **Response Selection Tracking**: Maintaining and improving functionality to track which AI responses were selected by the user and using only those for conversation context.

## Recent Changes

1. **Unified Model Definition System**:
   - Created a new shared definition file `models-shared.ts` with common model and provider types
   - Centralized core model data in a single source of truth
   - Updated client-side model definitions to derive from shared models
   - Modified server-side model definitions to extend shared models with API-specific details
   - Eliminated duplication between frontend and backend model definitions
   - Improved type safety with specific provider ID types

2. **Fixed Width Chat Interface**:
   - Increased chat window width to a fixed 1024px for better readability
   - Enhanced layout for a more consistent user experience
   - Improved visual design of model response tabs
   - Added dynamic model information display from centralized configuration

3. **Dynamic Model Response Handling**:
   - Updated the response handling system to dynamically process all models defined in the configuration
   - Implemented a more flexible approach to adding responses to the chat history
   - Improved vote counting and winner determination with model-agnostic code

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added better environment variable validation for API keys
   - Improved error reporting for missing API keys
   - Added graceful degradation when model clients are unavailable

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Resolve Path-Related TypeScript Issues**:
   - Fix module import errors related to the new model shared definitions
   - Ensure consistent path resolution between client and server code
   - Consider relocating shared files to a common location for better imports

2. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add keyboard navigation for the tab interface
   - Implement dark mode toggle
   - Improve mobile responsiveness for the tabbed interface
   - Add visual transitions when switching between tabs

3. **Advanced Context Management**:
   - Implement token counting for context window management
   - Add conversation truncation for very long conversations
   - Create more sophisticated context filtering options

4. **Model Context Protocol Integration**:
   - Explore integration with Fetch MCP Server for AI assistant web content access
   - Research and potentially implement MCP server for contextual enhancements
   - Consider configuration options for MCP integration in the project

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Additional User Controls**:
   - Add user preferences for default models
   - Implement custom system prompts per model
   - Create model comparison analytics

2. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Implement fallback strategies for when specific models are unavailable
   - Create a monitoring system for API performance and availability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Shared Type System Architecture**:
   - Evaluating the best location for shared type definitions to avoid import issues
   - Considering whether to place shared files in a dedicated folder structure
   - Exploring options for automatic type generation from a single source

2. **Model Management Strategy**:
   - Evaluating the most flexible way to handle model parameters and configuration
   - Considering options for user-configurable model settings
   - Planning for potential addition of new models in the future with minimal code changes

3. **Chat UI Layout**:
   - Currently using a fixed-width layout (1024px) for the chat interface
   - Considering responsive design improvements for different screen sizes
   - Evaluating the balance between content readability and space utilization

4. **Conversation History Management**:
   - Continuing to refine the system where only selected responses are included in history
   - Considering options for allowing users to revisit and potentially edit previous selections
   - Evaluating the impact of limited context on model performance for long conversations
