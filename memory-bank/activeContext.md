# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the existing multi-model AI chat application with the following key areas of work:

1. **System Stability**: Ensuring robust error handling across all AI model providers to maintain a consistent user experience even when specific models or APIs fail.

2. **UI/UX Refinement**: Refining the chat interface to clearly present responses from multiple models while maintaining an intuitive and clean user experience.

3. **Conversation Context**: Working on implementing conversation history maintenance and context management for more coherent interactions.

## Recent Changes

1. **API Integration**:
   - Successfully integrated OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o-mini)
   - Added Gemini model integration with OpenAI-compatible endpoint
   - Implemented Claude model integration with OpenAI-compatible endpoint

2. **Voting System**:
   - Implemented cross-model voting mechanism where each model evaluates responses from all models
   - Added visual highlighting for the "winning" response based on votes
   - Included vote counts in the UI to provide transparency in the selection process

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for API failures
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks when specific models fail to respond
   - Created dedicated error components for different error states

4. **UI Components**:
   - Designed and implemented a responsive chat interface
   - Added loading indicators for better user feedback during API calls
   - Created visual differentiation between responses from different models

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Conversation Context**:
   - Implement conversation history maintenance
   - Add context window management for longer conversations
   - Create a system for managing conversation state across sessions

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement response streaming for faster initial feedback
   - Add caching mechanisms for repeated queries
   - Optimize parallel API calls to reduce overall response time

3. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Implement fallback strategies for when specific models are unavailable
   - Create a monitoring system for API performance and availability

### Medium-term Goals
1. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add user preferences for default models
   - Implement a dark/light mode toggle
   - Create a more interactive voting display

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - Add temperature and other parameter controls
   - Implement custom system prompts per model
   - Create model comparison analytics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Conversation Persistence**:
   - Evaluating options for storing conversation history (client-side vs. server-side)
   - Considering privacy implications of conversation storage
   - Determining the scope of history to maintain (session-only vs. long-term)

2. **Model Selection Strategy**:
   - Considering alternatives to the current voting mechanism
   - Evaluating whether to add user override of model selection
   - Exploring adaptive model selection based on query type

3. **API Resilience**:
   - Designing strategies for handling API rate limits
   - Planning for service outages from specific providers
   - Implementing cost control mechanisms for API usage
