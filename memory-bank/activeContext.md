# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the existing multi-model AI chat application with the following key areas of work:

1. **Model and Provider Management**: Implementation of a centralized system for defining models and providers, making it easier to add new models or providers to the application.

2. **UI/UX Refinement**: Improvements to the chat interface layout, particularly focusing on a consistent and wider display for better readability.

3. **Conversation History Management**: Ongoing enhancements to the system that only includes selected AI responses in the conversation history, with a mechanism to lock older selections.

4. **Response Selection Tracking**: Maintaining and improving functionality to track which AI responses were selected by the user and using only those for conversation context.

## Recent Changes

1. **Centralized Model and Provider System**:
   - Created a server-side model configuration in `src/app/api/chat/models.ts` with interfaces for providers and models
   - Added a client-side model metadata file in `src/app/api/models.ts` for UI-specific model information
   - Updated API routes to dynamically handle models from the centralized configuration
   - Refactored the Chat component to use the shared model definitions
   - Made adding new models and providers significantly easier by centralizing definitions

2. **Chat UI Improvements**:
   - Increased chat window width to a fixed 1024px for better readability
   - Enhanced layout for a more consistent user experience
   - Improved visual design of model response tabs
   - Added dynamic model information display from centralized configuration

3. **Refactored Model Response Handling**:
   - Updated the response handling system to dynamically process all models defined in the configuration
   - Implemented a more flexible approach to adding responses to the chat history
   - Improved vote counting and winner determination with model-agnostic code

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added better environment variable validation for API keys
   - Improved error reporting for missing API keys
   - Added graceful degradation when model clients are unavailable

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add keyboard navigation for the tab interface
   - Implement dark mode toggle
   - Improve mobile responsiveness for the tabbed interface
   - Add visual transitions when switching between tabs

2. **Advanced Context Management**:
   - Implement token counting for context window management
   - Add conversation truncation for very long conversations
   - Create more sophisticated context filtering options

3. **Model Context Protocol Integration**:
   - Explore integration with Fetch MCP Server for AI assistant web content access
   - Research and potentially implement MCP server for contextual enhancements
   - Consider configuration options for MCP integration in the project

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Additional User Controls**:
   - Add user preferences for default models
   - Implement custom system prompts per model
   - Create model comparison analytics

2. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Implement fallback strategies for when specific models are unavailable
   - Create a monitoring system for API performance and availability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Model Management Strategy**:
   - Evaluating the most flexible way to handle model parameters and configuration
   - Considering options for user-configurable model settings
   - Planning for potential addition of new models in the future

2. **Chat UI Layout**:
   - Currently using a fixed-width layout (1024px) for the chat interface
   - Considering responsive design improvements for different screen sizes
   - Evaluating the balance between content readability and space utilization

3. **Conversation History Management**:
   - Continuing to refine the system where only selected responses are included in history
   - Considering options for allowing users to revisit and potentially edit previous selections
   - Evaluating the impact of limited context on model performance for long conversations

4. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**:
   - Evaluating the benefits of integrating Fetch MCP for web content access
   - Considering the implementation complexity vs. benefits for the current project scope
   - Researching best practices for MCP configuration in Next.js applications
