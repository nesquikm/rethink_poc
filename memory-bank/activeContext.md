# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing the existing multi-model AI chat application with the following key areas of work:

1. **UI/UX Refinement**: Improvements to the tabbed interface for AI responses, with a focus on conversation history management and response selection functionality.

2. **Conversation History Management**: Implementation of a system that only includes selected AI responses in the conversation history, with a mechanism to lock older selections.

3. **Response Selection Tracking**: Adding functionality to track which AI responses were selected by the user and using only those for conversation context.

4. **System Stability**: Ensuring robust error handling across all AI model providers to maintain a consistent user experience even when specific models or APIs fail.

## Recent Changes

1. **Conversation History Selection System**:
   - Implemented logic to track which AI response was selected for each conversation turn
   - Added `isSelected` property to the `ChatMessage` type to indicate user selection
   - Updated the conversation history to only include user-selected responses
   - Added visual indicators (badges) for selected responses
   - Locked older answer selections to prevent changing history retroactively
   - Only the most recent turn allows switching between different AI responses

2. **Tabbed Response Interface Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the tab interface to visually indicate selected responses in previous turns
   - Added reduced opacity and disabled state for tabs in older turns
   - Implemented tab locking for all turns except the most recent
   - Added "SELECTED" badge to indicate which response was chosen in past turns
   - Maintained the winning response highlight for the latest turn

3. **API Message Conversion Enhancement**:
   - Updated `convertToAPIMessages` function to filter and only include selected responses
   - Implemented grouping by turn ID for proper conversation organization
   - Enhanced the message filtering logic to maintain conversation coherence

4. **State Management Improvements**:
   - Added last turn ID tracking to identify the most recent conversation turn
   - Implemented state for active tabs across all conversation turns
   - Created effect hooks to update selection status when tab choices change

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add keyboard navigation for the tab interface
   - Implement dark mode toggle
   - Improve mobile responsiveness for the tabbed interface
   - Add visual transitions when switching between tabs

2. **Advanced Context Management**:
   - Implement token counting for context window management
   - Add conversation truncation for very long conversations
   - Create more sophisticated context filtering options

3. **Model Context Protocol Integration**:
   - Explore integration with Fetch MCP Server for AI assistant web content access
   - Research and potentially implement MCP server for contextual enhancements
   - Consider configuration options for MCP integration in the project

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Additional User Controls**:
   - Add user preferences for default models
   - Implement custom system prompts per model
   - Create model comparison analytics

2. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Implement fallback strategies for when specific models are unavailable
   - Create a monitoring system for API performance and availability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Conversation History Management**:
   - Currently implemented a system where only selected responses are included in history
   - Considering options for allowing users to revisit and potentially edit previous selections
   - Evaluating the impact of limited context on model performance for long conversations

2. **Tab Interface Experience**:
   - Evaluating whether to add more information to the tab headers
   - Considering adding tooltips to explain tab functionality (locked vs. active)
   - Exploring options for improving tab accessibility with keyboard navigation

3. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**:
   - Evaluating the benefits of integrating Fetch MCP for web content access
   - Considering the implementation complexity vs. benefits for the current project scope
   - Researching best practices for MCP configuration in Next.js applications

4. **Context Window Management**:
   - Evaluating options for handling long conversations (token counting vs message-based truncation)
   - Considering strategies for maintaining context relevance with selected-only responses
   - Determining the optimal balance between context length and API costs
