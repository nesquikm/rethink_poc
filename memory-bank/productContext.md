# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Rethink AI POC is designed to address the growing complexity of choosing the right AI model for specific queries. With multiple strong AI models available (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), each with different strengths and weaknesses, users often face the challenge of selecting the most appropriate model for their needs. This project aims to:

1. **Reduce Model Selection Friction**: By querying multiple models at once, users don't need to decide which model might provide the best answer.

2. **Demonstrate Multi-Model Evaluation**: Showcase how AI models can evaluate each other and provide a form of "consensus" on quality.

3. **Explore AI Voting Mechanisms**: Test whether AI models can effectively judge the quality of responses, potentially leading to better response selection systems.

4. **Create a Unified Interface**: Build a single interface for accessing multiple AI providers without needing separate applications.

## Problems Being Solved

1. **Model Selection Uncertainty**: Users are often unsure which AI model would be best for a particular question.

2. **Quality Assessment**: Difficult for users to evaluate the accuracy and quality of AI-generated responses without domain expertise.

3. **Provider Lock-in**: Current solutions often tie users to a single AI provider.

4. **Response Variance**: Different models may excel at different types of questions, and users benefit from seeing multiple perspectives.

5. **Transparency in AI**: Limited visibility into how different models approach the same problem.

## How It Should Work

The user experience flow should be:

1. User submits a question through the chat interface
2. All configured AI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini, Claude) receive the question in parallel
3. Each model generates a response to the question
4. Each model then evaluates all responses (including its own) to vote on the best one
5. All responses are displayed to the user, with the "winner" (based on votes) highlighted
6. Users can see which model provided each response and the vote distribution
7. Users can continue the conversation with follow-up questions

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean and intuitive, focusing on the conversation.

2. **Transparency**: Users should clearly see which model provided each response and why a particular response was selected as best.

3. **Response Differentiation**: Visual distinction between responses from different models, with clear highlighting for the "winning" response.

4. **Seamless Interaction**: Loading states that provide feedback without disrupting the flow of conversation.

5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of API failures without breaking the user experience.

6. **Comparative Insight**: Enable users to compare how different models respond to the same prompt, providing educational value.

7. **Immediate Value**: Prioritize getting a high-quality response quickly, with the voting mechanism adding value without introducing significant delays.

## Target Users

1. **AI Enthusiasts**: People interested in comparing outputs from different AI models
2. **Researchers**: Those studying AI response patterns and quality
3. **Developers**: Engineers looking for implementation examples of multi-model integration
4. **General Users**: Anyone seeking high-quality AI responses without needing to choose a specific model
